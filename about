    <p>
        My name is Sason (Suh-sawn). I‚Äôm a college graduate and network test engineer with an interest in artificial
        intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, and motorsports. I graduated in 2018 with a cybersecurity-focused
        bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Science and have since been working in the industry as a systems software engineer while
        refining my cybersecurity skills and learning new computer science subjects.

        <br>I have been surrounded by computers and technology my whole life, and, as a result, developed a genuine
        passion for learning, improving, and optimizing (also known as min-maxing). This passion stems from playing
        competitive video games, both online and against my brother/cousins, throughout my childhood ‚Äì specifically
        Warcraft III, Overwatch, Rocket League, and even Toontown Online ‚Äì which requires executing actions in the most
        optimal sequences. I was the youngest kid around so I was never allowed to play first. Instead, I watched
        attentively, analyzed their moves, and noted any mistakes or moves which could be optimized. When it was finally
        my turn to play, I would capitalize on their mistakes and optimize my moves to quickly beat them. My competitive
        gaming family turned me into the min-maxer I am today, and now I‚Äôm able to apply these analytical techniques to
        all aspects of my life and career. üôÇ
        <br>Other than min-maxing, I enjoy tinkering and stress testing (commonly known as breaking things and then
        fixing them). Playing video games made me competitive and analytical but also sprung a small curiosity in me
        regarding my limits: ‚ÄúTo what extent are my skills limited? Well, I don‚Äôt know, let‚Äôs play for hours on end
        until I find out.‚Äù After countless hours playing a video game, I learned what I was capable of and now it was
        time to see what the game was capable of. I started thinking of how I could go beyond the limits of the video
        game and do things that I wasn‚Äôt necessarily supposed to do. While most of it was silly stuff, such as feeding
        my Chao‚Äôs infinite chaos drives in Sonic Adventure 2, it taught me to think outside the box. And it‚Äôs been the
        same story since, but now I test the limits of everything in sight, rather than only video game functionality.
        <br>Cyber security and artificial intelligence are exactly the fields to fuel my competitive, curious mindset:
        Never-ending amounts of applications for me to tinker with and break, unique and creative methods/solutions to
        learn from created by people all over the world, and the competition to get your name out there. All of the
        other Computer Science fields simply can‚Äôt match the excitement of cyber security and artificial intelligence.

        About My Blog<br>
        I created a blog so I can document the efforts of further understanding, and demonstrating, my ever-growing
        knowledge of topics related to cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. By no means am I an
        expert in any of these topics, but I hope to share my adventure of becoming one. Computer science is quite an
        interesting and wide-ranging field, and I hope my blog posts will be able to teach you a thing or two about
        these captivating topics.

        What‚Äôs up with the Mr. Bean theme?<br>
        I grew up watching a lot of Mr. Bean. He‚Äôs goofy and always gets himself into the strangest predicaments.
        Despite the goofiness and shenanigans, Bean is quite inspirational in his ability to screw everything up in the
        most absurd fashion and think outside of the box to develop unique solutions. For example, take the episode
        where Bean makes a sandwich on a park bench (watch it on YouTube).
        After all these years of watching Mr. Bean, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the first thing that runs through my head
        when probing an application or bug hunting is, ‚ÄúWhat would Mr. Bean do?‚Äù

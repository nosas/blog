    <h1> About My Website</h1>
    This website documents my efforts of further understanding, and demonstrating, my ever-growing
    knowledge of topics related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, and (sometimes)
    cybersecurity.
    <br>
    By no means am I an expert in any of these topics, but I hope to share my adventure of becoming one. Computer
    science is quite an interesting and wide-ranging field, and I hope my articles will be able to teach you a thing
    or two about these captivating topics.

    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <b><i>tldr;</i></b> I've been around computers my whole life and, as a result, developed a passion for optimizing
    everything in sight. My other passions - competitive gaming, motorsports, bodybuilding - fuel my min-maxing
    lifestyle. I graduated with a Cybersecurity-focused Computer Science degree, but I am pivoting to AI/ML because it
    brings me more joy and has far more positive impacts to our world.

    <br><br>My name is <b>Sason</b> (<i>Sauce-on</i> for the Iranians, <i>Suh-sawn</i> for everyone else) or
    <b>Reza</b>, whichever is easier. I'm a network automation engineer with a fascination in artificial intelligence,
    machine learning, cybersecurity, and motorsports. I graduated in 2018 with a cybersecurity-focused bachelor's in
    Computer Science and have since been working in the industry as a systems software engineer while refining my
    cybersecurity skills and learning new computer science subjects.

    <br><br>I have been surrounded by computers and technology my whole life, and, as a result, developed a genuine
    passion for learning, improving, and optimizing (also known as <i>min-maxing</i>). This passion stems from playing
    competitive video games, both online and against my brother/cousins, throughout my childhood - specifically
    Warcraft III, Overwatch, Rocket League, and even Toontown Online - which requires executing actions in the most
    optimal sequences. I was the youngest kid around so I was never allowed to play first. Instead, I watched
    attentively, analyzed their moves, and noted any mistakes or moves which could be optimized. When it was finally
    my turn to play, I would capitalize on their mistakes and optimize my moves to quickly beat them. My competitive
    gaming family turned me into the min-maxer I am today, and now I'm able to apply these analytical techniques to
    all aspects of my life and career.

    <br><br>Other than min-maxing, I enjoy tinkering and stress testing (commonly known as breaking things and then
    fixing them). Playing video games made me competitive and analytical but also sprung a small curiosity in me
    regarding my limits: “To what extent are my skills limited? Well, I don't know, let's play for hours on end
    until I find out.” After countless hours playing a video game, I learned what I was capable of and now it was
    time to see what the game was capable of. I started thinking of how I could go beyond the limits of the video
    game and do things that I wasn't necessarily supposed to do. While most of it was silly stuff, such as feeding
    my Chao's infinite chaos drives in Sonic Adventure 2, it taught me to think outside the box. And it's been the
    same story since, but now I test the limits of everything in sight, rather than only video game functionality.

    <br><br>Cyber security and artificial intelligence are exactly the fields to fuel my competitive, curious mindset:
    Never-ending amounts of applications to tinker with and break, unique and creative methodologies to
    learn from created by people all over the world, and the competition to get your name out there. All of the
    other Computer Science fields simply can't match the excitement of cyber security and artificial intelligence.

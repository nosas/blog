<h1 id="minimax-search-in-mancala">Minimax search in Mancala</h1>

<p>Minimax search is a fundamental depth-first search algorithm used in Artificial Intelligence, decision theory, game theory, and statistics.
The purpose of minimax search is to  <strong>minimize the maximum loss</strong> in a worst-case scenario - or, simply put, figure out the best action to pursue in a worst-case scenario.</p>

<p>This algorithm can be implemented in <em>n</em>-player games but is most commonly implemented in 2-player zero-sum games such as checkers, chess, connect 4, mancala, tic-tac-toe, etc.
Zero-sum games are simplified as turn-based games where one player wins and, as a result, the other player loses.</p>

<p>In this article we'll discuss what minimax search is, the related vocabulary, search tree structure and process, a basic example, and, finally, implement minimax in mancala.</p>

<h2 id="minimax-vocabulary">Minimax vocabulary</h2>

<p>Let's familiarize ourselves with minimax-related variables and keywords before we implement minimax searches.</p>

<h2 id="minimax-tree-structure">Minimax tree structure</h2>

<p>Suppose we're playing a 2-player turn-based game where each player has a choice between two actions per turn.
The branching factor, <code>b</code>, will be equal to 2.
We'll configure the algorithm to search to a depth of 3, which will set the variable <code>d</code> equal to 3.</p>

<p>Given the variables <code>b</code>=2 and <code>d</code>=3, the algorithm will generate the following tree structure:</p>

    <figcaption>Tree generated by minimax with the branching factor of 2 and depth of 3 </figcaption>
</figure>

<!-- ![Minimax tree structure](img/minimax_tree.png) -->

<p>The number of heuristic evaluations - also called <em>terminal nodes</em>, seen in the figure above as v1-v8 - completed in a minimax search tree is denoted by: <strong>b<sup>d</sup></strong>.
It's important to notice that the size of the search tree increases exponentially based on <strong>how deep the algorithm searches</strong> and <strong>how large the branching factor is</strong>.</p>

<p>We have a mere 2<sup>3</sup> (8) heuristics evaluations in the tree above when looking 3 moves ahead.
However, the tree represents an arbitrary game for which there are only two possible actions per turn.</p>

<p>Consider chess, where the branching factor (possible moves) is exactly 20 for opening moves and about 35<sup>[2]</sup> for the remainder of the game.
If we re-configured our minimax algorithm's branching factor (<code>b</code>) to reflect the number of possible moves in chess, we would have to perform roughly 35<sup>3</sup> (42,875) heuristic evaluations.
And that's only looking 3 moves ahead!</p>

<p>The last thing to consider about these trees is that <strong>the branching factor is not always uniform</strong>.
Just because there are two possible moves this turn, it doesn't mean there will be two possible moves next turn.
Perhaps there is only one possible move next turn or even no possible moves, meaning you've either won or lost.</p>

<p>Looking at chess again: there are 20 possible opening moves, that is known.
After the first move, and depending on which piece is moved, there can be anywhere from 20-29 moves.
The opening move below allows for 29 possible moves on white's next turn - or 28 possible moves if black moves their pawn to d5.</p>
